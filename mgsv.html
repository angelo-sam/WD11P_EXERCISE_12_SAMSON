Originally an assassin for XOF, Quiet later defected to Diamond Dogs after being defeated by Venom Snake. Quiet wore a minimal amount of clothing at all times because she could only drink or breathe through her skin following parasite-treatment due to the serious injuries she had sustained while trying to kill Big Boss during the hospital raid; wearing too much clothing would lead to suffocation..</p>

Snake subdued Eli and returned with him to Mother Base.</p>
