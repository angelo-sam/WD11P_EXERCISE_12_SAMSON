              <p class="card-text text-white">3 months later, in December 1998, Claire infiltrates Umbrella's Paris facility in France in search of her brother Chris. At some point in her investigation, her presence was detected, and a security team was dispatched along with a military chopper to eliminate her. After evading the security force, and having narrowly evaded helicopter gunfire, she was ambushed by the team's remainder, and captured by Rodrigo Juan Raval. She was then taken to Rockfort Island to be imprisoned. Upon her arrival, she is knocked unconscious. She later awakens to the sound of explosions and is freed by a wounded Rodrigo.</p>

While in Europe investigating Umbrella's activities, Chris' own activities made him a wanted target for Umbrella. This is what helped Leon S. Kennedy in tracking him down. Leon, a friend of Claire's after they cooperated to escape Raccoon City, was e-mailed by Claire asking him to find Chris. He passed on Claire's message for help, prompting Chris to abandon his mission and head to Rockfort Island.</p>
